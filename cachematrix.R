# Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit
# to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly. The
# following two functions are used to cache the inverse of a matrix.

# The first function, makeCacheMatrix, creates a list containing a function to
# 1. set the value of the matrix
# 2. get the value of the matrix
# 3. set the value of inverse of the matrix
# 4. get the value of inverse of the matrix


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  inv <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x  <<- y
    inv <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
  getinverse <- function() inv
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}

## The following function calculates the 
## mean of the special "vector" created with
## the above function. However, it first checks 
## to see if the inverse has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the data and 
## sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the setinverse function.
## Computing the inverse of a square matrix can be done with 
## the solve function in R. 
## For example, if X is a square invertible matrix, 
## then solve(X) returns its inverse.


cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  inv <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(inv)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(inv)
  }
  matrix <- x$get()
  inv <- solve(matrix)
  x$setinverse(inv)
  inv
}
